#Tanks2D by Rafa Kopczy≈Ñski

What is it?
-------------------------------------------

This is clone of popular "Tanks" video game made in C++ and free SFML Graphics library. Project was created by me while studying.

How to run
------------

Project is possible to compile only on MS Visual Studio 2013. MS Visual Studio 2015 makes problem with this build (possible change of SFML libraries should solve problem)
However you can still run my game - just unzip "PlayAbleZip.zip" and launch *exe file :)

Licensing
---------

Yet still uncomplete, but see LICENSE
