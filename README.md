What is it?
-------------------------------------------

This is a clone of popular "Battle City" video game:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_City_(video_game) 
I have created this project during studies and I has been created using C++ and
free 2D library - SFML. See http://www.sfml-dev.org/

How to compile
--------------

At this moment, the project is compileable only with Visual Studio 2013. All necessary dependencies are
included to repository and there shouldn't be any problem. In the other way - contact with me and I'll
try to help you.
With Visual Studio 2015 it could be a problem, because all libs are now outdated.
Probably upgrade of SFML libs could help, but I haven't test it.

How to run
------------
The easies way to run my game - just get "PlayableZip", unpack it and enjoy :)

Licensing
---------

For me this game is absolutely open source.
With no varranty I provide it for you "as-is", whatever when it would be used for.
Of course I will be glad if someone notice, that some part of code comes from me :)

This game was created with:

"8-bit" music: http://www.bfxr.net/

2D engine: http://sfml-dev.org/
