What is it?
-------------------------------------------

This is clone of popular "Battle City" video game:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_City_(video_game) 
I created this project when I was studying and I used for it C++ and
free 2D SFML library. See http://www.sfml-dev.org/

How to compile
--------------

Now project is possibel to compile only with Visual Studio 2013. All necessary dependencies are
included to repository and there shouldn't be any problem. In other way - contact with me, so I'll
try to help you.
With Visual Studio 2015 it could be a problem, because all libs are now out of date.
Probably change of SFML libs could help, but I haven't test it.

How to run
------------

The easies way to run my game - just get "PlayableZip", unpack it and enjoy :)

Licensing
---------

For me this game is absolutely free source.
With no varranty I provide it for you "as-is", whatever when it would be used for.
Of course I will be glad if someone notice, taht some part of code comes from me :)

This game was created with:

"8-bit" music: http://www.bfxr.net/

2D engine: http://sfml-dev.org/

See also license: https://github.com/RKopczynski/Tanks2D/blob/master/SFML_lib/license.txt

(probably) all pictures: https://www.gimp.org/
